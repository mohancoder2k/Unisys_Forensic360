### Crime Scene Reconstruction Application Using AI  

#### 🌟 **Introduction**  
- 🕵️‍♂️ Real-time crime scene investigation tool for CID teams.  
- 🖼️ Creates accurate 3D reconstructions using AI for spatial analysis, evidence annotation, and event simulation.  

#### 🎯 **Objective**  
- 🔍 Solve cases by reconstructing events and analyzing evidence.  
- 🧩 Provide accurate visualizations and insights for identifying suspects and verifying witness statements.  

#### 💡 **Proposed Solution**  

**1️⃣ Data Collection**  
- 📸 **Image/Video Capture**:  
  - High-resolution images/videos via smartphones, drones, or DSLR cameras.  
  - Record crime scene layout with evidence points (e.g., bullet casings, blood spatters).  
- 🖥️ **Depth Sensors/LiDAR** (if available):  
  - Generate spatial data and object measurements.  
- 🏷️ **Evidence Annotation**:  
  - Tag evidence (e.g., guns, blood stains) with metadata (timestamps, locations).  

**2️⃣ Reconstruction and Analysis**  
- 🖼️ **Image Processing**:  
  - Use photogrammetry to stitch images for a composite scene.  
  - AI detection to mark evidence points.  
- 🎥 **3D Model Creation**:  
  - Interactive models for scene revisitation.  
- 🔫 **Bullet Trajectory Analysis**:  
  - Predict bullet paths, entry wounds, and shooter positions.  
- 🩸 **Blood Spatter Analysis**:  
  - Reconstruct victim positions and movement from bloodstains.  
- 👁️ **Witness Verification**:  
  - Simulate and compare witness statements with line-of-sight evidence.  

**3️⃣ Real-Time Features**  
- ⏳ **Simulations**:  
  - Recreate event sequences (suspect entry, victim movement, gunshots).  
- 🤝 **Interactive Collaboration**:  
  - Enable investigators and forensic experts to re-analyze scenes.  

#### 🖥️ **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React.js, Three.js (for 3D models).  
- **Backend**: Flask.  
- **AI Tools**: TensorFlow, OpenCV, custom trajectory and spatter analysis algorithms.  

#### 🚀 **Output**  
- 🔍 **3D Models**: High-precision, interactive visualizations of crime scenes.  
- 📊 **Automated Reports**: Evidence and trajectory analysis for courtroom presentations.  
- ⏩ **Faster Investigations**: Streamlined processes, reduced errors, and efficient insights.  

#### 🌟 **Future Developments**  
- 🌐 **Cloud Integration**: Real-time collaboration across CID teams globally.  
- 🤖 **Advanced AI Models**: Improved accuracy in evidence detection and reconstruction.  
- 📱 **Mobile Support**: Lightweight app for on-the-go data capture and analysis.  
- 🛡️ **Blockchain**: Secure evidence storage for chain-of-custody verification.  

This application revolutionizes forensic investigations by combining precision, scalability, and real-time processing.
